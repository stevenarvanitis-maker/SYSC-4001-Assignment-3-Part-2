When an exec call succeeds, the current process is replaced by a new program. The OS throws away the old code, data, and stack, loads the new program into memory, and begins executing it from its entry point, but the process keeps the same PID. If exec fails, it simply returns −1 and nothing is replaced; the original program continues. Exec generally fails only when something prevents the kernel from loading the new program—for example, the file doesn’t exist, isn’t a valid executable format, or the calling process doesn’t have permission to run it. In practice, a failed exec just means the kernel couldn’t perform the replacement, so the process keeps running its old image.
